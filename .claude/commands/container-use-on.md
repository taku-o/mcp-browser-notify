# Container-Use On

Enable Container-Use development environment for special cases

## Description

Switch to Container-Use environment for specific scenarios requiring environment isolation. This mode uses mcp__container-use__* tools exclusively and provides automatic Git operations. Use this when you need special environment handling - standard development should use the default tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash).
